## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
API that I created for technical test in kitabisa.com using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Docker
There are 5 endpoints in this API
There is no endpoint to remove team nor player because it's not a requirement (it can be added quite easily though)


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
It's very easy to start the API.
```
docker-compose up -d
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

or you can just execute 
```
run.bat / run.sh (depending on what OS you use)
```

### Prerequisites
```
Maven
Docker
Java 8
```


```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be
